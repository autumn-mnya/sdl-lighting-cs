# Welcome to the lighting engine file, here you can determine how light is displayed in-game

# 4 Things emit light, NPC's, Quote, Bullets, and particles. Internally these are called NpChar, MyChar, Bullet, and Caret.
# By default, the lighting engine will try to approximate how lighting should look, the defaults are:
# Resize light to framerect size, Solid white max brightness.

# The defines below overwrite default lighting behaviour.

# To define custom light, use "TYPE_ID = #..."
# Valid types: NPC, MYCHAR, BULLET, CARET

# Format: RED,GREEN,BLUE.  In hexadecimal, use an online colour picked if you dont know how this works. Or ask.

# The "#FF0000" is the red colour, the "#FF" is max brightness, and "#1.2" is the size multiplier.
# Default size is 1.5x the size of the framerect.
NPC_111 = #FF0000 #FF #1.2

# There is only 1 MyChar (for now) (the player), so we use id 0
MYCHAR_0 = #FFFFFF #FF #5.0

# Bullets [Look in Bullet.cpp ActBullet() for bullet id's] (https://gitlab.com/generic-username/tscextended/-/blob/master/src/Bullet.cpp#L2300)
BULLET_1 = #FFFFFF #FF #1.2

# Carets [Look in Caret.cpp, gCaretTable for the ids] (https://gitlab.com/generic-username/tscextended/-/blob/master/src/Caret.cpp#L25)
CARET_0 = #FFFFFF #FF #1.3
